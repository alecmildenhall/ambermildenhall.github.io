              Mikaela Mullaney Straus (born December 19, 1998), known professionally by the pseudonym King Princess, is an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer from Brooklyn, New York. She is currently signed onto Mark Ronson's Zelig Records label and was the first artist to sign onto that label. In February 2018, she released her debut single "1950" which charted on multiple charts, most notably #17 on the US Alternative Song Charts. Straus followed this with her second single "Talia" in April 2018. She later released her debut EP Make My Bed on June 15, 2018 which also peaked at #1 of the Hot New Zealand Music Charts.

King Princess identifies as genderqueer and uses she/her pronouns. Moreover, she identifies as gay. In an interview by MTV News, Straus explains that she chose her stage name because it "encompasses the complexity of [her] gender".

Called “the most prolific creator of his generation,” Donald Glover is the brain child behind the FX TV comedy Atlanta. He not only stars in the show but also serves as its creator, producer, director and co-writer. Outside of his work on Atlanta, Glover is also a Grammy-Award winning rapper who goes by the stage name Childish Gambino and a stand-up comedian.
            Along with his acclaimed work on Atlanta, Glover is a successful rapper who has released three albums – Camp (2011), Because the Internet (2013) and Awaken My Love! (2016) – all under the name Childish Gambino. The name was produced at random by the Wu-Tang Clan’s Name Generator.
